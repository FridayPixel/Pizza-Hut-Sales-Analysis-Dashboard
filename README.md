#🧠 DAX Formulas Used
🔷 Core KPI Measures
Total Revenue = SUM(Sales[total_price])
Total Orders = DISTINCTCOUNT(Sales[order_id])
Total Pizzas Sold = SUM(Sales[quantity])
Avg Order Value = DIVIDE([Total Revenue], [Total Orders])
Avg Pizza Per Order = DIVIDE([Total Pizzas Sold], [Total Orders])

🔷 Category & Size Measures
Revenue by Category = SUM(Sales[total_price])
Quantity by Category = SUM(Sales[quantity])
Revenue by Size = SUM(Sales[total_price])
Quantity by Size = SUM(Sales[quantity])

🔷 Date Intelligence
Day Name = FORMAT(Sales[order_date], "DDD")
Month Name = FORMAT(Sales[order_date], "MMM")
Month Number = MONTH(Sales[order_date])

🔷 Pizza-Level Performance
Revenue by Pizza = SUM(Sales[total_price])
Quantity by Pizza = SUM(Sales[quantity])

🔷 % Contribution Metrics
% Category Sales = DIVIDE([Revenue by Category], [Total Revenue])
% Category Quantity = DIVIDE([Quantity by Category], [Total Pizzas Sold])
% Size Sales = DIVIDE([Revenue by Size], [Total Revenue])
% Size Quantity = DIVIDE([Quantity by Size], [Total Pizzas Sold])
